# Abbey Starter Kit Policies with JIT and Attribute-Based Access Example

This example shows how to create a Grant Kit.
The example features requesting access to a [Snowflake Role Grant](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/role_grants)
from multiple reviewers, requiring only `one_of` the reviewers to approve the access.

This Grant Kit will auto-grant access upon approval.

However, it will automatically revoke access after a 24-hour period because
of the `deny[msg] { ... }` rule in the Rego code. If you want the OPA policy evaluation to pass the check,
then you can replace `deny` (mandatory enforcement) with `warn` (advisory enforcement).
If you want to disable the policy evaluation, then delete the `policies` block in the `grant_kit` resource.

## Usage
